# What is skeletor?

Unlike its [namesake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletor), this `skeletor`
does not (yet) seek to conquer Eternia but to turn meshes into skeletons.

Before we get started some terminology:

- a *mesh* is something that consists of *vertices* and *faces*
- a *skeleton* is a (hierarchical) tree-like structure consisting of *vertices*
  (also called *nodes*) and *edges* that connect them

Skeletons are useful for a range of reasons. For example:

1. Typically smaller (less vertices) than the mesh
2. Have an implicit sense of topology (e.g. "this node is distal to that node")

Extracting skeletons from meshes (or other types of data such as voxels) is
non-trivial and there are a great many research papers exploring various
different approaches (see [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar
?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=skeleton+extraction&btnG=)).

`skeletor` implements some algorithms that I found useful in my work with
neurons. In my experience there is unfortuntely no magic bullet when it
comes to skeletonization and chances are you will have to fiddle around a bit
to get decent results.

# Installation

From PyPI:
```bash
pip3 install skeletor
```

For the bleeding-edge version from Github:
```bash
pip3 install git+git://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor@master
```

# Getting started

A skeletonization pipeline typically consists of:

1. Some pre-processing of the mesh (e.g. fixing some potential errors like
   degenerate faces, unreferenced vertices, etc.)
2. The skeletonization itself
3. Some post-processing of the skeleton (e.g. adding radius information)

------

See docstrings of the respective functions for details.

A pipeline might look like this:

 1. `skeletor.pre.fix_mesh()` to fix the mesh
 2. `skeletor.pre.simplify()` to simplify the mesh
 3. `skeletor.pre.contract()` to contract the mesh [1]
 4. `skeletor.skeletonize.vertex_clusters()` to generate a skeleton
 5. `skeletor.post.clean_up()` to clean up some potential issues with the skeleton
 6. `skeletor.post.radii()` to extract radii either by k-nearest neighbours or ray-casting

In my experience there is no one-size-fits-all. You will have to play around to
find the right approach and parameters to get nice skeletons for your meshes.
If you need help just open an [issue](https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor/issues).

Also check out the Gotchas below!

# Examples

First load the example mesh (a fruit fly neuron):

```Python
>>> import skeletor as sk
>>> mesh = sk.example_mesh()
>>> mesh
<trimesh.Trimesh(vertices.shape=(6582, 3), faces.shape=(13772, 3))>
```

Next see if there is stuff to fix in the mesh (degenerate faces, duplicate
vertices, etc.):

```Python
>>> fixed = sk.pre.fix_mesh(mesh, remove_disconnected=5, inplace=False)
>>> fixed
<trimesh.Trimesh(vertices.shape=(6213, 3), faces.shape=(12805, 3))>
```

Now for tubular meshes like this neuron, the "wave front" skeletonization method
performs really well: it works by casting waves across the mesh and collapsing
the resulting rings into a skeleton (kinda like when you throw a stone in a
pond and track the expanding ripples).

```Python
>>> skel = sk.skeletonize.by_wavefront(fixed, waves=1, step_size=1)
>>> skel
<Skeleton(vertices=(1258, 3), edges=(1194, 2), method=wavefront)>
```

All skeletonization methods return a `Skeleton` object. These are just
convenient objects to bundle the various outputs of the skeletonization.

```Python
>>> # x/y/z location of skeleton vertices (nodes)
>>> skel.vertices
array([[16744, 36720, 26407],
       ...,
       [22076, 23217, 24472]])
>>> # child -> parent edges
>>> skel.edges
array([[  64,   31],
       ...,
       [1257, 1252]])
>>> # Mapping for mesh to skeleton vertex indices
>>> skel.mesh_map
array([ 157,  158, 1062, ...,  525,  474,  547])
>>> # SWC table
>>> skel.swc.head()
   node_id  parent_id             x             y             z    radius
0        0         -1  16744.005859  36720.058594  26407.902344  0.000000
1        1         -1   5602.751953  22266.756510  15799.991211  7.542587
2        2         -1  16442.666667  14999.978516  10887.916016  5.333333
```

SWC is a commonly used format for saving skeletons. `Skeleton` objects
have a method for quickly saving a correctly formatted SWC file:

```Python
>>> skel.save_swc('~/Documents/my_skeleton.swc')
```

If you installed `pyglet` (see above) you can also use `trimesh`'s plotting
capabilities to inspect the results:

```Python
>>> skel.show(mesh=True)
```

<img src="https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor/raw/master/_static/example1.png" alt="skeletor_example" width="100%"/>

That looks pretty good already but let's run some pro-forma postprocessing.

```Python
>>> sk.post.clean_up(skel, inplace=True)
<Skeleton(vertices=(1071, 3), edges=(1070, 2))>
```

So that would be a full pipeline mesh to skeleton. Don't expect your own meshes
to produce such nice results off the bat though. Chances are you will need to
play around to find the right recipe. If you don't know where to start, I suggest
you try out mesh contraction + vertex clustering first:

```Python
>>> import skeletor as sk
>>> mesh = sk.example_mesh()
>>> fixed = sk.pre.fix_mesh(mesh, remove_disconnected=5, inplace=False)
>>> # Contract mesh to 10% (0.1) of original volume
>>> cont = sk.pre.contract(fixed, epsilon=0.1)
>>> # Skeletonize
>>> skel = sk.skeletonize.by_vertex_clusters(cont, sampling_dist=100)
>>> # Replace contracted mesh with original for postprocessing and plotting
>>> skel.mesh = fixed
>>> # Add radii (vertex cluster method does not do that automatically)
>>> sk.post.radii(skel, method='knn')
>>> skel.show(mesh=True)
```

# Gotchas

- while this is a general purpose library, my personal focus is on neurons and
  this has certainly influenced things like default parameter values and certain
  post-processing steps
- meshes need to be triangular (we are using `trimesh`)
- use `sk.pre.simplify` if your mesh is very complex (half a million vertices is
  where things start getting sluggish)
- a good mesh contraction is often half the battle
- if the mesh consists of multiple disconnected pieces the skeleton will
  likewise be fragmented (i.e. will have multiple roots)

# Benchmarks

<img src="https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor/raw/master/benchmarks/benchmark_2.png" alt="skeletor_benchmark" width="100%"/>

[Benchmarks](https://github.com/schlegelp/skeletor/blob/master/benchmarks/skeletor_benchmark.ipynb)
were run on a 2018 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz Core i7, 32Gb memory) with optional
`fastremap` dependency installed. Note some of these functions (e.g.
contraction and TEASAR/vertex cluster skeletonization) vary a lot in
speed based on parameterization.

# What about algorithm `X`?

`skeletor` contains some algorithms that I found easy enough to implement
and useful for my work with neurons. If you have some interesting paper/approach
that could make a nice addition to `skeletor`, please get in touch on Github.
Pull requests are always welcome!

you probably won't ever need to touch manually). Everything else is neatly
tucked away into submodules (see side-bar or above table).
